# ee491a
This repository contains the work done in EE491A(UGP). The paper [Trajectory-Constrained Collective Circular Motion With Different Phase Arrangements](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8827634) has been simulated in MATLAB first and then simulation of a new problem has been done and is being improved for better results.

### Instructions to run:
- Run the [main.m](https://github.com/kpiyush25/ee491a/blob/main/simulation_using_euler_approximation/main.m) file to run the simulation using the functions mentioned in the paper using Euler Approximation.
- Run the [main.m](https://github.com/kpiyush25/ee491a/blob/testing/params/simulation_using_ode45/simulation_reference_paper/main.m) file to run the simulation using the functions mentioned in the paper using ODE45.
- Run the [main2.m](https://github.com/kpiyush25/ee491a/blob/testing/params/simulation_using_ode45/simulation_our_paper/main2.m) file to run the simulation using our functions using ODE45.
